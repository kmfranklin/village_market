# Introduction

Hi, I'm Kevin Franklin, and this is Village Market, an online hub for a local farmers market.

The site allows the general public to explore upcoming events, vendors, and products.
Vendors can manage their listings and market attendance, and admins have tools to oversee everything and keep the site up to date with no technical experience required.

# Problem & Purpose

Local vendors needed a better way to share what they're bringing to the farmers market each week. Shoppers wanted to know who would be there and what they could expect to find.

Village Market helps strengthen community connections and makes it easier to support small, local businesses. It gives vendors a platform for visibility and gives shoppers a way to plan their visit and engage with the people growing their food and crafting their goods.

# Walkthrough

## Public View

### Homepage

The homepage highlights the next market date, hours, and contact info.

It shows a random mix of products for the next market, removing the need for manual updates and giving every vendor a chance to be featured.

### Vendors & Products

Visitors can browse vendors or filter products by category or vendor.

Each vendor has a personalized profile page with a business description, contact info, and images.

### FAQ & Registration

The FAQ helps new vendors understand what’s expected and how to get involved.

## Vendor View

I'll log in as a vendor to show what they see.

### Dashboard Overview

In the last week of each month, a banner reminds vendors to update their anticipated attendance for the upcoming month.

There’s also a calendar for quick reference, and easy links to manage their profile, products, and attendance.

### Product Management

Vendors can view, filter, and manage their products.

Products are separated into “Active” and “Inactive” to make organization easier.
Let me show how a product is added — and how it appears on their list once saved.

### Profile Updates

Vendors can update their business name, description, contact info, and images.

I’ll quickly save a change here and show how it updates in real time.

### Attendance

Here’s where vendors confirm which markets they’ll attend.

Checkboxes tie directly into the dashboard and update their calendar status.

### Logout

Vendors have a personalized icon to access their account or sign out.

## Admin View

Now I’ll sign in as an admin.

### Dashboard & Products

Admins can view and manage all vendor products.

They have the same ability to add, edit, and delete items, but with global access and the ability to select which vendor a product should belong to.

### Vendor Management

Here’s the vendor management screen, where admins can approve pending vendor applications, suspend or restore vendors, and permanently delete suspended accounts.

Each vendor status is clearly sorted by tab.

### Homepage Management

Admins can update homepage content from here.

They can change the hero image using a modal gallery, update announcements, and adjust contact details.

Let me save a quick update — and show that it’s immediately reflected on the homepage.

# Personal Reflection

I’m most proud of how polished and complete the site feels — every part works together and is easy to use.

I really enjoyed designing a system that could genuinely help small farms and local vendors connect with their community. During my initial research, I didn’t find many modern, user-friendly sites for farmers markets — so I’m proud to have a product that could be used in the real world to help build community involvement and engagement.

The biggest challenge was managing this project while learning new tools, starting a new career, balancing other classes, and avoiding burnout. But I stuck with it, and picked up valuable habits and a deeper understanding of how to build something from scratch.

One major lesson I learned is to stay flexible. I’m someone who likes structure, but in projects like this, things break and plans change — and that’s okay.
Being able to pivot and troubleshoot is part of the process.

Also... I learned that AwardSpace is not ideal for a project this size. That’s a lesson I’ll take with me for sure!
